# TerraRoad

TerraRoad is a Terragen road creator!  It combines a heightfield exported from Terragen with an svg path defining a road shape, and creates a new heightfield with the road path leveled and smoothed.  The tool also creates a variety of masks that can be used in Terragen for shading the road and shoulder.
